## Usage

- Click on the aspect ratio button you want to set. In the case of an aspect ratio greater than 1, the script fixes the width and changes the height. Whereas if the aspect ratio is smaller than 1, the width changes while the height is fixed.
- Reset image resolution by clicking on one of the buttons on the second row. This will set a 1:1 aspect ratio.

### Configuration

Aspect ratios can be defined in the `/sd-webui-ar/aspect_ratios.txt` file. The file is pre-populated with the most common values

```
1:1, 1.0
3:2, 1.5
4:3, 1.333
16:9, 1.777
# 6:13, 0.461538
# 9:16, 0.5625
# 3:5, 0.6
# 2:3, 0.666
# 19:16, 1.19 # fox movietone
# 5:4, 1.25 # medium format photo
# 11:8, 1.375 # academy standard
# IMAX, 1.43
# 14:9, 1.56
# 16:10, 1.6
# ùúë, 1.6180 # golden ratio
# 5:3, 1.6666 # super 16mm
# 1.85, 1.85 # US widescreen cinema
# DCI, 1.9 # digital imax
# 2:1, 2.0 # univisium
# 70mm, 2.2
# 21:9, 2.370 # cinematic wide screen
# Œ¥, 2.414 # silver ratio
# UPV70, 2.76 # ultra panavision 70
# 32:9, 3.6 # ultra wide screen
# PV, 4.0 # polyvision
```

Note the `#` marking the line as a comment, i.e. the extension is not reading that line. To use a custom value, un-comment the relative line by removing the starting `#`. 
A custom aspect ratio is defined as `button-label, aspect-ratio-value # comment`. The `aspect-ratio-value` must be a number (either `float` or `int`) while the `# comment` is optional.

Resolutions are defined in the same into `resolutions.txt` file. By default this reads

```
# 416, 416
512, 512
# 768, 768
```

thus only 416x416 preset is loaded onto the webui.
